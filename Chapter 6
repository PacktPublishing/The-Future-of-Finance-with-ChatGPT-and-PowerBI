Obtain the Twitter API (if you don’t have one already)
To obtain Twitter API credentials, you must first create a Twitter Developer account and create an 
application. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
1. Create a Twitter Developer account.
• Navigate to the Twitter Developer’s site (https://developer.twitter.com/en/ apps).
• Click Apply for a developer account.
• Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.
2.  Create a new application:
• After your developer account is approved, navigate to Dashboard and click on Create an app.
• Fill out the required fields, such as App name, Application Description, and Website URL.


• You will need Basic Level access to search tweets, which costs $100 a month. Free access does not 
include the ability to search tweets, which is required to complete the following example.
3.  Obtain your API keys:
• After your application is created, you will be redirected to the app’s dashboard.
• Navigate to the Keys and Tokens tab.
• Here, you’ll find your API key and API secret key under the Consumer Keys section.
• Scroll down, and you’ll see the Access token & access token secret section. Click on Generate
to create your access token and access token secret.
You’ll need all four of these keys (API Key, API Secret Key, Access Token, and Access Token Secret) 
to interact with Twitter’s API programmatically.
Important note
Keep these keys confidential. Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.

4.  After obtaining these credentials, you can use them in your Python script to connect to the 
Twitter API, like so:
• Install the Tweepy library first:
pip install tweepy
• Run the following Python code:
import tweepy

consumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY' consumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET' access_token = 
'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret) auth.set_access_token(access_token, 
access_token_secret)

api = tweepy.API(auth)
Replace 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY', 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET', 'YOUR_
ACCESS_TOKEN', and 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET' with your actual Twitter API credentials.



Remember to follow Twitter’s policies and guidelines when using their API, including the 
limitations they place on the number of requests your app can make in a given period.

Data collection
We’ll use Tweepy to access the Twitter API. This step requires your own Twitter Developer API keys:
import tweepy

# Replace with your own credentials consumer_key = 'YourConsumerKey' consumer_secret = 
'YourConsumerSecret' access_token = 'YourAccessToken' access_token_secret = 'YourAccessTokenSecret'

# Authenticate with Twitter
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret) auth.set_access_token(access_token, 
access_token_secret)

api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Replace 'Silicon Valley Bank' with the name of the bank you want to research
public_tweets = api.search('Silicon Valley Bank')

# Loop to print each tweet text for tweet in public_tweets:
print(tweet.text)

Important note
'Silicon Valley Bank' is the example name for the bank in the preceding Python code snippet. You 
should replace this with the name of the bank you are interested in researching.

In the provided Python code, the main objective is to connect to Twitter’s API and collect tweets 
that mention a specific bank name.
Here’s a breakdown of what the code accomplishes:
• Obtaining the Twitter API credentials: Creating a Twitter Developer account and an application to 
get API keys (a consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret).
•  Importing the Tweepy Library: The tweepy library is imported to facilitate API interaction.


•  Setting API credentials: Replacing placeholders such as 'YourConsumerKey' and 
'YourConsumerSecret', with your actual API credentials. These keys authenticate your application 
and provide access to Twitter’s API.
•  Initializing OAuthHandler: Creating an OAuthHandler instance with your consumer key and consumer 
secret. This object will handle authentication.
•  Setting access tokens: Access tokens are set to complete the OAuth process, making your 
application authorized to interact with Twitter on behalf of your account.
•  Initializing an API object: Initializing the Tweepy API object with the authentication details.
•  Collect tweets: Finally, tweets containing the name of a specific bank ('YourBankName') are 
searched for and stored in the public_tweets variable.
•  Adhering to Twitter policies: Be mindful of Twitter’s API usage policies and limitations on the 
number of API calls.
This code serves as a foundational step for any project requiring Twitter data related to banking 
or financial institutions.

Here is a Python script using the Tweepy library to access the Twitter API. This script finds 
tweets with a specific hashtag and calculates a weighted sentiment score based on likes and 
retweets:
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob
# Twitter API credentials (you'll need to get these from your Twitter account)
consumer_key = 'your-consumer-key' consumer_secret = 'your-consumer-secret' access_token = 
'your-access-token' access_token_secret = 'your-access-token-secret'

# Authenticate with the Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret) auth.set_access_token(access_token, 
access_token_secret) api = tweepy.API(auth)
# Define the search term and the date_since date search_words = "#YourBankName"
date_since = "2023-07-01"

# Collect tweets
tweets = tweepy.Cursor(api.search_tweets, # Updated this line q=search_words,
lang="en", since=date_since).items(1000)
# Function to get the weighted sentiment score def get_weighted_sentiment_score(tweet):
likes = tweet.favorite_count retweets = tweet.retweet_count
sentiment = TextBlob(tweet.text).sentiment.polarity


# Here, we are considering likes and retweets as the weights. # You can change this formula as per 
your requirements. return (likes + retweets) * sentiment

# Calculate the total sentiment score
total_sentiment_score = sum(get_weighted_sentiment_score(tweet) for tweet in tweets)

print("Total weighted sentiment score: ", total_sentiment_score)

This script retrieves tweets with a specific hashtag and then calculates a sentiment score for each 
tweet, weighted by the number of likes and retweets. It sums up these weighted scores to give a 
total sentiment score.
Please note that Twitter’s API has rate limits, meaning that there’s a limit to the number of 
requests you can make in a certain amount of time. You will need the Basic level of Twitter API 
access to search tweets, which is $100 per month.
Also, remember to replace 'YourBankName' with the actual name or hashtag that you are interested 
in, and set ‘date_since’ to the date from which you want to start collecting tweets. Finally, 
you’ll need to replace 'your-consumer-key', 'your-consumer-secret', 'your-access- token', and 
'your-access-token-secret' with your actual Twitter API credentials.

Tracking traditional indicators
We’ll use yfinance, which allows you to download stock data:
• Install the yfinance library first:
pip install yfinance
• Run the following Python code:
import yfinance as yf

data = yf.download('YourTickerSymbol','2023-01-01','2023-12-31')

Formulating trading signals
Let’s say that if the average sentiment score is positive and the stock price has increased, it’s a 
buy signal. Otherwise, it’s a sell signal:
1. Install NumPy:
pip install numpy


Harnessing the social pulse – the Sentinel Strategy for banking trading decisions  11



2. Run the following Python code:
import numpy as np

# Ensure tweets is an array of numerical values if len(tweets) > 0 and np.all(np.isreal(tweets)):
avg_sentiment = np.mean(tweets) else:
avg_sentiment = 0 # or some other default value

# Calculate the previous close prev_close = data['Close'].shift(1)

# Handle NaN after shifting prev_close.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)

# Create the signal
data[‘signal’] = np.where((avg_sentiment > 0) & (data[‘Close’] > prev_close), ‘Buy’, ‘Sell’)

The backtest strategy
Backtesting requires historical data and simulation of the strategy performance. Let’s use SVB as 
our backtest example:
1.  Timeframe: March 8–March 10, 2023
2. Stock symbol – SIVBQ (after the collapse in March 2023)
3. Focus on tweets that mention or hashtag SVB, SIVB, or Silicon Valley Bank
• Install pandas and textblob (if not already installed):
pip install pandas pip install textblob
• Run the following Python code:
import pandas as pd import tweepy
import yfinance as yf
from textblob import TextBlob

try:
# Twitter API setup consumer_key = "CONSUMER_KEY"
consumer_secret = "CONSUMER_SECRET"



access_key = "ACCESS_KEY" access_secret = "ACCESS_SECRET"

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret) auth.set_access_token(access_key, 
access_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Hashtags and dates
hashtags = ["#SVB", "#SIVB", "#SiliconValleyBank"] start_date = "2023-03-08"
end_date = "2023-03-10"

# Fetch tweets tweets = []
for hashtag in hashtags:
for status in tweepy.Cursor(api.search_tweets, q=hashtag, since=start_date, until=end_date, 
lang="en").items():
tweets.append(status.text)

# Calculate sentiment scores
sentiment_scores = [TextBlob(tweet).sentiment.polarity for tweet in tweets]

# Generate signals
signals = [1 if score > 0 else -1 for score in sentiment_ scores]

# Fetch price data
data = yf.download("SIVBQ", start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Data alignment check
if len(data) != len(signals):
print("Data length mismatch. Aligning data.") min_length = min(len(data), len(signals)) data = 
data.iloc[:min_length]
signals = signals[:min_length]

# Initial setup position = 0
cash = 100000

# Backtest
for i in range(1, len(data)): if position != 0:



cash += position * data['Close'].iloc[i] position = 0
position = signals[i] * cash
cash -= position * data['Close'].iloc[i]

# Calculate returns
returns = (cash - 100000) / 100000 print(f"Returns: {returns}")

except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

Implementing the strategy
You would typically use a broker’s API for this. However, implementing such a strategy requires 
careful management of personal and financial information, as well as a good understanding of the 
financial risks involved.
As an example, we will use Alpaca, which is a popular broker that provides an easy-to-use API for 
algorithmic trading.
Note that to actually implement this code you will need to create an Alpaca account and replace 
'YOUR_APCA_API_KEY_ID' and 'YOUR_APCA_API_SECRET_KEY' with your real Alpaca API key and secret:
1.  Install the Alpaca Trade API:
pip install alpaca-trade-api
2. Run the following Python code:
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

# Create an API object
api = tradeapi.REST('YOUR_APCA_API_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_APCA_API_ SECRET_KEY', 
base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets')

# Check if the market is open clock = api.get_clock()
if clock.is_open:
# Assuming 'data' is a dictionary containing the signal (Replace this with your actual signal data)
signal = data.get('signal', 'Hold') # Replace 'Hold' with your default signal if 'signal' key is 
not present

if signal == 'Buy':


api.submit_order( symbol='YourTickerSymbol', qty=100,
side='buy', type='market', time_in_force='gtc'

)
elif signal == 'Sell': position_qty = 0 try:
position_qty = int(api.get_ position('YourTickerSymbol').qty)
except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
if position_qty > 0: api.submit_order(
symbol='YourTickerSymbol', qty=position_qty, side='sell', type='market', time_in_force='gtc'
)

Here is a Python code snippet using the requests library to pull the CAR and bank name data:
1.  Install the requests library (if not already installed).
pip install requests
2. Run the following Python code:
import requests import json import csv
# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with the API key you got from FRED api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
symbol = 'BANK_STOCK_SYMBOL' # Replace with the stock symbol of the bank
bank_name = 'BANK_NAME' # Replace with the name of the bank

# Define the API URL
url = f"https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/ 
observations?series_id={symbol}&api_key={api_key}&file_ type=json"
try:
# Make the API request response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status()

# Parse the JSON response
data = json.loads(response.text) # Initialize CSV file
csv_file_path = 'capital_adequacy_ratios.csv'


with open(csv_file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile: fieldnames = ['Bank Name', 'Date', 'CAR']
writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
# Write CSV header writer.writeheader()
# Check if observations exist in the data if 'observations' in data:
for observation in data['observations']:
# Write each observation to the CSV file writer.writerow({'Bank Name': bank_name, 'Date':
observation['date'], 'CAR': observation['value']}) else:
print("Could not retrieve data.") except requests.RequestException as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

IMPORTANT
Make sure to include your FRED API key, the stock symbol of the ban    t to research,
and the name of the bank that matches the stock symbol you entered.

The NLP component
We will utilize Twitter sentiment analysis with weighted engagement as our secondary soft financial 
indicator. Here’s an example of how you might set this up in Python:
1. Install Twython package (if not already installed):
pip install twython
2. Run the following Python code:
from twython import Twython from textblob import TextBlob
# Assuming you are using TextBlob
for sentiment analysis

# Replace 'xxxxxxxxxx' with your actual Twitter API keys
twitter = Twython('xxxxxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxxxxx')

def calculate_sentiment(tweet_text):
# Example implementation using TextBlob
return TextBlob(tweet_text).sentiment.polarity

def get_weighted_sentiment(hashtags, since, until): try:
# Replace twitter.search with twitter.search_tweets
search = twitter.search_tweets(q=hashtags, count=100, lang='en', since=since, until=until)
weighted_sentiments = []




for tweet in search['statuses']:
sentiment = calculate_sentiment(tweet['text']) weight = 1 + tweet['retweet_count'] +
tweet['favorite_count']
weighted_sentiments.append(sentiment * weight)

if len(weighted_sentiments) == 0:
return 0 # or handle it as you see fit

return sum(weighted_sentiments) / len(weighted_ sentiments)

except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}") return None

Portfolio rebalancing
You can set up a routine in Python to perform the preceding actions periodically. This will 
typically involve scheduling a task using libraries such as schedule or APScheduler.
Here’s an example of how you might use the schedule library to periodically rebalance your 
portfolio. This is a simple code snippet, and you would need to fill in the actual trading logic:
1.  Install the schedule package first:
pip install schedule
2. Run the following Python code:
import schedule import time

def rebalance_portfolio(): try:
# Here goes your logic for rebalancing the portfolio print("Portfolio rebalanced")
except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred during rebalancing: {e}")

# Schedule the task to be executed every day at 10:00 am 
schedule.every().day.at("10:00").do(rebalance_portfolio)

while True: try:

Harnessing the social pulse – the Sentinel Strategy for banking trading decisions  19
# Run pending tasks schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(1)
except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
In this example, the rebalance_portfolio function is scheduled to be run every day at 10:00 am. The 
actual rebalancing logic should be placed inside the rebalance_portfolio function. The while True 
loop at the end is used to keep the script running continuously, checking for pending tasks every 
second.

Risk management
To set stop losses and take profit levels, you can add some additional logic to your trading 
decisions:
# Define the stop-loss and take-profit percentages stop_loss = 0.1
take_profit = 0.2
# Make sure buy_price is not zero to avoid division by zero errors if buy_price != 0:
# Calculate the profit or loss percentage price_change = (price / buy_price) - 1

# Check if the price change exceeds the take-profit level if price_change > take_profit:
print("Sell due to reaching take-profit level.")

# Check if the price change drops below the stop-loss level elif price_change < -stop_loss:
print("Sell due to reaching stop-loss level.")


else:
print("Buy price is zero, cannot calculate price change.")

In the provided Python code, multiple components are integrated to create a trading strategy based 
on both hard financial data and Twitter sentiment. First, the script loads CAR data for a specific 
bank from a CSV file, using the Pandas library. It then uses Twitter sentiment, weighted by 
engagement metrics such as likes and retweets, as a secondary indicator. Based on these two factors 
– CAR and weighted sentiment – the script triggers trading decisions to buy, sell, or hold. 
Additionally, the code includes mechanisms for portfolio rebalancing, scheduled to run daily at 
10:00 am, and risk management
through stop losses and take-profit levels.

Follow these Python code instructions:
import pandas as pd import logging
def save_df_to_csv(df: pd.DataFrame, file_path: str = 'my_data.csv'): # Check if DataFrame is empty
if df.empty:
logging.warning("The DataFrame is empty. No file was saved.") return
try:
# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv(file_path, index=False)


logging.info(f"DataFrame saved successfully to {file_path}") except Exception as e:
logging.error(f"An error occurred while saving the DataFrame to a CSV file: {e}")
# Example usage
# Assuming df contains your data
# save_df_to_csv(df, 'my_custom_file.csv')

This section provides instructions on how to create a web app named BankHealthMonitorAgent and 
employs BabyAGI for task management. This agent can be used as a comprehensive, methodical way of 
assessing a bank’s financial health. This section aims to demonstrate how multiple cutting-edge 
technologies come together to create an accessible, robust tool for financial analysis:
1.  Building the web app: Before starting, make sure you have signed up for Databutton, as it will 
be the foundation for our web app development and deployment. Install the required dependencies – 
langchain, openai, faiss-cpu, and tiktoken and streamlit.



2.  Importing the installed dependencies: Import the necessary packages to build the web app:
# Import necessary packages from collections import deque
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

import streamlit as st
from langchain import LLMChain, OpenAI, PromptTemplate from langchain.embeddings.openai import 
OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.llms import BaseLLM
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.vectorstores.base import VectorStore from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
3.  Create the BankRegulatorGPT agent: Now, let’s define the BankRegulatorGPT agent using Langchain 
and OpenAI GPT-4. The agent will be responsible for generating insights and recommendations, based 
on the financial health monitoring results:
class BankRegulatorGPT(BaseModel):
"""BankRegulatorGPT - An intelligent financial regulation model."""

@classmethod
def from_llm(cls, llm: BaseLLM, verbose: bool = True) -> LLMChain:
"""Get the response parser."""
# Define the BankRegulatorGPT template bank_regulator_template = (
"You are an intelligent financial regulation model, tasked with analyzing"
" a bank's financial health using the following key indicators: {indicators}."
" Based on the insights gathered from the BankHealthMonitorAgent, provide"
" recommendations to ensure the stability and compliance of the bank."
)
prompt = PromptTemplate( template=bank_regulator_template, input_variables=["indicators"],



)
return cls(prompt=prompt, llm=llm, verbose=verbose)

def provide_insights(self, key_indicators: List[str]) ->
str:



"""Provide insights and recommendations based on key indicators."""
response = self.run(indicators=", ".join(key_ indicators))
return response

4.  Task Creation Agent: Create the Task Creation Agent class that generates new tasks, based on 
insights obtained from BankHealthMonitorAgent:
class TaskCreationChain(LLMChain): """Chain to generate tasks."""

@classmethod
def from_llm(cls, llm: BaseLLM, verbose: bool = True) -> LLMChain:
"""Get the response parser."""
# Define the Task Creation Agent template task_creation_template = (
"You are a task creation AI that uses insights from the BankRegulatorGPT"
" to generate new tasks. Based on the following insights: {insights},"
" create new tasks to be completed by the AI


system."

)


" Return the tasks as an array."


prompt = PromptTemplate( template=task_creation_template, input_variables=["insights"],


)
return cls(prompt=prompt, llm=llm, verbose=verbose)

def generate_tasks(self, insights: Dict) -> List[Dict]: """Generate new tasks based on insights.""" 
response = self.run(insights=insights)
new_tasks = response.split("\n")
return [{"task_name": task_name} for task_name in new_ tasks if task_name.strip()]
5.  Task Prioritization Agent: Implement the Task Prioritization Agent that reprioritizes the task 
list:
class TaskPrioritizationChain(LLMChain): """Chain to prioritize tasks."""

@classmethod

def from_llm(cls, llm: BaseLLM, verbose: bool = True) -> LLMChain:
"""Get the response parser."""
# Define the Task Prioritization Agent template task_prioritization_template = (
"You are a task prioritization AI tasked with reprioritizing the following tasks:"
" {task_names}. Consider the objective of your


team:"
" {objective}. Do not remove any tasks. Return the


result as a numbered list,"
" starting the task list with number {next_task_


id}."


)
prompt = PromptTemplate( template=task_prioritization_template, input_variables=["task_names", 
"objective", "next_


task_id"],
)
return cls(prompt=prompt, llm=llm, verbose=verbose)

def reprioritize_tasks(self, task_names: List[str], objective: str, next_task_id: int) -> 
List[Dict]:
"""Reprioritize the task list."""
response = self.run(task_names=task_names, objective=objective, next_task_id=next_task_id)
new_tasks = response.split("\n") prioritized_task_list = []
for task_string in new_tasks: if not task_string.strip():
continue
task_parts = task_string.strip().split(".", 1) if len(task_parts) == 2:
task_id = task_parts[0].strip() task_name = task_parts[1].strip()
prioritized_task_list.append({"task_id": task_ id, "task_name": task_name})
return prioritized_task_list
6. Execution Agent: Implement the Execution Agent to execute tasks and get the results:
class ExecutionChain(LLMChain): """Chain to execute tasks."""

vectorstore: VectorStore = Field(init=False)

@classmethod def from_llm(
cls, llm: BaseLLM, vectorstore: VectorStore, verbose: bool = True
) -> LLMChain:
"""Get the response parser."""
# Define the Execution Agent template execution_template = (
"You are an AI who performs one task based on the following objective: {objective}."
" Take into account these previously completed tasks: {context}."
" Your task: {task}." " Response:"


)
prompt = PromptTemplate( template=execution_template,
input_variables=["objective", "context", "task"],

results = self.vectorstore.similarity_search_with_ score(query, k=k)
if not results: return []
sorted_results, _ = zip(*sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))
return [str(item.metadata["task"]) for item in sorted_
results]

def execute_task(self, objective: str, task: str, k: int = 5) -> str:
"""Execute a task."""
context = self._get_top_tasks(query=objective, k=k) return self.run(objective=objective, 
context=context,
task=task)
7.  BabyAGI Controller: Create the BabyAGI Controller model to manage tasks, executing the
BabyAGI(BaseModel) class:
class BabyAGI:
"""Controller model for the BabyAGI agent."""

8.  The Vectorstore: Now, let’s create the Vectorstore that will store the embeddings for task 
execution:
def initial_embeddings(openai_api_key, first_task): # Define your embedding model
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
openai_api_key=openai_api_key, model="text-embedding-

return vectorstore

9.  The main UI: Finally, let’s build the main frontend to accept the objective from the user and 
run the BankRegulatorGPT agent:
def main():

vectorstore=vectorstore, objective=OBJECTIVE, first_task=first_task,


)

with st.spinner("BabyAGI at work ..."): baby_agi.run(max_iterations=max_iterations)

st.balloons() except Exception as e:
st.error(e)

if  name  == " main ": main()



10. Add a stop button: To add the stop button, we’ll modify the BabyAGI class to include a flag 
that indicates whether the agent should continue running or stop. We’ll also update the run method 
to check this flag at each iteration and stop when the user clicks the Stop button:
class BabyAGI(BaseModel):
"""Controller model for the BabyAGI agent.""" # ... (previous code)
def  init (self, *args, **kwargs): super(). init (*args, **kwargs) self.should_stop = False

def stop(self):
"""Stop the agent.""" self.should_stop = True

def run(self, max_iterations: Optional[int] = None): """Run the agent."""
num_iters = 0
while not self.should_stop: if self.task_list:
# ... (previous code)


iterations:


num_iters += 1
if max_iterations is not None and num_iters == max_

self.print_task_ending() break


11. Update the main UI to include the stop button: Next, we need to add the Stop button in the main 
user interface and oversee its functionality:
def main():
# ... (previous code)

if openai_api_key:
# ... (previous code)


vectorstore = initial_embeddings(openai_api_key, first_
task)


baby_agi = None

if st.button("Let me perform the magic"): try:
bank_regulator_gpt = BankRegulatorGPT.from_llm( llm=OpenAI(openai_api_key=openai_api_key)


)
baby_agi = BabyAGI.from_llm_and_objective( llm=OpenAI(openai_api_key=openai_api_key), 
vectorstore=vectorstore, objective=OBJECTIVE, first_task=first_task,

)

with st.spinner("BabyAGI at work ..."): baby_agi.run(max_iterations=max_iterations)
st.balloons() except Exception as e:
st.error(e)

if baby_agi:
if st.button("Stop"): baby_agi.stop()
With these modifications, the web app now includes a Stop button that allows users to terminate the 
BankRegulatorGPT agent’s execution at any time during its operation. When the user clicks the Stop 
button, the agent will stop running, and the interface will display the final results. If the user 
does not click the Stop button, the autonomous agent will continue running and performing tasks 
until it either finishes all iterations or completes all tasks. If the user wants to stop the agent 
before that, they can use the Stop button to do so.
The web app allows users to input the bank’s stock symbol, and it interacts with the 
BankRegulatorGPT agent, which utilizes Langchain and OpenAI GPT-4 to provide insights and 
recommendations, based on the financial health monitoring results. The app also manages task 
creation, prioritization, and execution using the BabyAGI Controller. Users can easily follow the 
instructions, input their objectives, and run the BankRegulatorGPT agent without the need for deep 
technical knowledge.

BankRegulatorGPT evaluates a variety of financial indicators to deliver a comprehensive analysis of 
a bank’s financial condition. This persona integrates several technologies, including Langchain for 
internet search and mathematical computation, GPT-4 for language understanding and generation,
Pinecone for vector search, and Databutton for an interactive web interface.

Data collection:
• Historical ETF data:
• Required information: Historical price and volume data for the regional bank ETF and IAT
• Here’s a Python code example:
import yfinance as yf

# Define the ETF symbol etf_symbol = "IAT"
# Fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance
etf_data = yf.download(etf_symbol, start="2022-06-30", end="2023-06-30")
# Save ETF data to a CSV file etf_data.to_csv("IAT_historical_data.csv")
• For the CRE vacancy rate data, we will use the quarterly office vacancy rates in the US from the 
website Statista: (https://www.statista.com/statistics/194054/ 
us-office-vacancy-rate-forecasts-from-2010/):
• Install the following before running python code (if not installed:
This code snippet will extract the quarterly office vacancy rates in the US for the specified time 
period (June 30, 2022, to June 30, 2023) from the Statista website:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import pandas as pd
# URL for the Statista website


url = "https://www.statista.com/statistics/194054/us-office- vacancy-rate-forecasts-from-2010/"

filtered_data = data[(data["Date"] >= start_date) & (data["Date"] <= end_date)]

# Print the filtered DataFrame to debug print("Filtered DataFrame:", filtered_data)

# Save filtered CRE Vacancy Rate data to a CSV file 
filtered_data.to_csv("CRE_vacancy_rate_data.csv")
If you have potential issues that could result in an empty table, we have added print statements to 
help identify where the potential issue might be so you can address it, such as the following:
1.  The website’s structure may have changed, which would affect the Beautiful Soup selectors
2.  The table may not exist on the page or may be loaded dynamically via JavaScript (which Python’s
requests library won’t handle)
3. The date range filtering might not be applicable to the data you have
• Financial news, articles, and user comments data:
Website: Yahoo Finance News (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/)
To extract data from the Yahoo Finance news website, you can use the following Python code snippet:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import pandas as pd

# URL for Yahoo Finance news website url = "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/"
headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'} # Send a GET request to the URL
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) if response.status_code != 200:
print("Failed to get URL") exit()

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

# Find all the news articles on the page
articles = soup.find_all("li", {"data-test": "stream-item"}) if not articles:

print("No articles found.") exit()

# Create empty lists to store the extracted data article_titles = []
article_links = [] user_comments = []

# Extract data for each article for article in articles:
title_tag = article.find("h3") link_tag = article.find("a")
title = title_tag.text.strip() if title_tag else "N/A" link = link_tag["href"] if link_tag else 
"N/A" article_titles.append(title) article_links.append(link)

# Extract user comments for each article

})

# Save financial news data to a CSV file data.to_csv("financial_news_data.csv")
else:
print("No article titles found. DataFrame not created.")
If you have potential issues that could result in an empty string or DataFrame, we have added print 
statements to help identify where the potential issue might be so you can address it, such as the 
following.


4.  The website structure may have changed, affecting the Beautiful Soup selectors
5.  Some articles might not have a title, link, or user comments, resulting in “N/A” or empty 
lists.
6. The site’s content could be loaded dynamically via JavaScript, which the requests library won’t 
handle.
This code snippet will extract the article titles, links, and user comments from the Yahoo Finance 
news website for references to the ETF, IAT, commercial real estate, or regional banks from June 
30, 2022 to June 30, 2023. You can further store this data in a suitable format, such as CSV or 
Excel, for later use in the trading strategy. Please note that web scraping should be done 
responsibly and in compliance with the website’s terms of service.
7.  Sentiment analysis using the OpenAI GPT API:
• Required information: API key for OpenAI GPT-4 API
• Website: OpenAI GPT-4 API (https://platform.openai.com/)
• Python Code Snippet for Sentiment Analysis:
• Installation required prior to running python code (if not already installed):
pip install openai pip install pandas
• Run python code below:
import openai import pandas as pd

# Initialize your OpenAI API key openai_api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" openai.api_key = 
openai_api_key

# Function to get sentiment score using GPT-4 (hypothetical) def get_sentiment_score(text):
# Make the API call to OpenAI GPT-4 (This is a placeholder; the real API call might differ)
response = openai.Completion.create(
engine="text-davinci-002", # Replace with the actual engine ID for GPT-4 when it becomes available
prompt=f"This text is: {text}", max_tokens=10



)

# Assume the generated text contains a sentiment label e.g., "positive", "negative", or "neutral"


sentiment_text = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip(). lower()

# Convert the sentiment label to a numerical score if "positive" in sentiment_text:
return 1
elif "negative" in sentiment_text: return -1
else:
return 0

# Load financial news data from the CSV file financial_news_data = 
pd.read_csv("financial_news_data.csv")

# Perform sentiment analysis on the article titles and user comments
financial_news_data['Sentiment Score - Article Title'] = financial_news_data['Article 
Title'].apply(get_sentiment_score)
financial_news_data['Sentiment Scores - User Comments'] = financial_news_data['User 
Comments'].apply(
lambda comments: [get_sentiment_score(comment) for comment in eval(comments)]
)

# Calculate total sentiment scores for article titles and user comments
financial_news_data['Total Sentiment Score - Article Title'] = financial_news_data['Sentiment Score 
- Article Title'].sum()
financial_news_data['Total Sentiment Scores - User Comments']
= financial_news_data['Sentiment Scores - User Comments']. apply(sum)

# Save the DataFrame back to a new CSV file with sentiment scores included
financial_news_data.to_csv('financial_news_data_with_sentiment. csv', index=False)
Ensure that you have the openai Python library installed and that you replace "YOUR_ 
OPENAI_API_KEY" with your actual API key for the GPT-4 API. Additionally, make sure you have proper 
permissions to use the API, and comply with the terms of service of the OpenAI GPT-4 API.
This example assumes that the 'User Comments' column in your financial_news_ data.csv contains 
lists of comments in the string format (e.g., "[comment1, comment2,
...]"). The eval() function is used to convert these stringified lists back into actual Python 
lists.



8. Volatility indicator:
• Required information: The historical price data of the regional bank ETF, IAT.
• A Python code example:
# Load ETF historical data from the CSV file etf_data = pd.read_csv("IAT_historical_data.csv")

# Calculate historical volatility using standard deviation def calculate_volatility(etf_data):
daily_returns = etf_data["Adj Close"].pct_change().dropna() volatility = daily_returns.std()
return volatility

# Calculate volatility for the IAT ETF volatility_iat = calculate_volatility(etf_data)
Note that the IAT-historical_data.csv file contains historical data for the iShares US Regional 
Banks ETF, represented by the acronym IAT. This data includes fields such as the adjusted close 
price, which is used to calculate historical volatility. The Python code to generate this file was 
provided at the bottom of page 41 and the top of page 42.
Ensure that the Adj Close column exists in your CSV file and that the IAT_historical_ data.csv file 
is in the same directory as your Python script, or provide the full path to the file.
Incorporating volatility into the trading strategy:
• Include the calculated volatility value as an additional variable in the trading strategy
• Use the volatility information to adjust trading signals based on the level of market volatility
• For example, consider higher volatility as an additional factor to generate buy/sell signals, or 
adjust the holding period based on market volatility
With the inclusion of the ETF’s historical volatility, the trading strategy can better capture and 
respond to market fluctuations, thus making more informed trading decisions.
9.  Trading strategy: To determine the thresholds for when to buy or sell the IAT ETF based on the 
quarterly vacancy rate, sentiment score, and volatility, we can update the trading strategy code 
snippet, as shown in the following Python code:
# Implement the trading strategy with risk management
def trading_strategy(cre_vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, volatility, entry_price):
stop_loss_percent = 0.05 # 5% stop-loss level take_profit_percent = 0.1 # 10% take-profit level



# Calculate stop-loss and take-profit price levels stop_loss_price = entry_price * (1 - 
stop_loss_percent) take_profit_price = entry_price * (1 + take_profit_percent)

if cre_vacancy_rate < 5 and sentiment_score > 0.5 and volatility > 0.2:
return "Buy", stop_loss_price, take_profit_price elif cre_vacancy_rate > 10 and sentiment_score < 
0.3 and
volatility > 0.2:
return "Sell", stop_loss_price, take_profit_price else:
return "Hold", None, None

# Sample values for demonstration purposes cre_vacancy_rate = 4.5
sentiment_score = 0.7
volatility = 0.25
entry_price = 100.0

# Call the trading strategy function
trade_decision, stop_loss, take_profit = trading_strategy(cre_ vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, 
volatility, entry_price)

print("Trade Decision:", trade_decision) print("Stop-Loss Price:", stop_loss) print("Take-Profit 
Price:", take_profit)
In this updated code snippet, we use cre_vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, and volatility as the input 
parameters for the trading strategy function. The trading strategy checks these key variables 
against specific thresholds to decide on whether to buy (“go long”), sell (“go short”), or hold the 
IAT ETF.
Note that the thresholds used in this example are arbitrary and may not be suitable for actual 
trading decisions. In practice, you would need to conduct thorough analysis and testing to 
determine appropriate thresholds for your specific trading strategy. Additionally, consider 
incorporating risk management and other factors into your trading strategy for more robust 
decision-making.
Now, based on the provided sample values for cre_vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, and volatility, the 
code will determine the trade decision (buy, sell, or hold) for the IAT ETF.
10. Risk management and monitoring: Here, you define the stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage 
risk.
You can set specific stop-loss and take-profit levels based on your risk tolerance and trading 
strategy. For example, you might set a stop-loss at a certain percentage below the entry price


to limit potential losses, and a take-profit level at a certain percentage above the entry price to 
lock in profits:
import pandas as pd

# Define the trading strategy function
def trading_strategy(cre_vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, volatility, entry_price):
stop_loss_percent = 0.05 # 5% stop-loss level take_profit_percent = 0.1 # 10% take-profit level

# Calculate stop-loss and take-profit price levels stop_loss_price = entry_price * (1 - 
stop_loss_percent) take_profit_price = entry_price * (1 + take_profit_percent)

if cre_vacancy_rate < 5 and sentiment_score > 0.5 and volatility > 0.2:
return "Buy", stop_loss_price, take_profit_price elif cre_vacancy_rate > 10 and sentiment_score < 
0.3 and
volatility > 0.2:
return "Sell", stop_loss_price, take_profit_price else:
return "Hold", None, None

# Sample values for demonstration purposes cre_vacancy_rate = 4.5
sentiment_score = 0.7
volatility = 0.25
entry_price = 100.0

# Call the trading strategy function
trade_decision, stop_loss, take_profit = trading_strategy(cre_ vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, 
volatility, entry_price)

# Create a DataFrame to store the trading strategy outputs output_data = pd.DataFrame({
"CRE Vacancy Rate": [cre_vacancy_rate], "Sentiment Score": [sentiment_score], "Volatility": 
[volatility],
"Entry Price": [entry_price], "Trade Decision": [trade_decision], "Stop-Loss Price": [stop_loss], 
"Take-Profit Price": [take_profit]
















































})

# Save the trading strategy outputs to a CSV file 
output_data.to_csv("trading_strategy_outputs.csv", index=False)
In this updated code snippet, we have introduced the stop_loss_percent and take_ profit_percent 
variables to set the desired stop-loss and take-profit levels as percentages. The trading strategy 
calculates the stop-loss and take-profit price levels based on these percentages, and the 
entry_price.
Note
The specific stop-loss and take-profit levels provided in this example are for demonstration 
purposes only. You should carefully consider your risk management strategy and adjust these levels 
according to your trading goals and risk appetite.

Now, the trading strategy function returns the trade decision (buy, sell, or hold) along with the 
calculated stop-loss and take-profit price levels, based on the provided sample values for 
cre_vacancy_rate, sentiment_score, volatility, and entry_price.
This section laid out a five-step process to build a trading strategy for a Regional Bank ETF, 
using the CRE vacancy rate and sentiment analysis data. First, we identified the required data 
sources and displayed how to collect this data using Python. Then, we explained how to use the 
OpenAI GPT API for sentiment analysis of financial news and comments. Subsequently, we incorporated 
the volatility of the ETF into the trading strategy. The fourth step involved forming the trading 
strategy with thresholds for buy/sell decisions, based on the CRE vacancy rate, sentiment score, 
and volatility. Finally, we discussed the importance of risk management and continuous monitoring 
of the relevant factors. It’s crucial to remember that this strategy is simplified and intended for 
educational purposes, and it does not assure profitable results. Professional advice should be 
sought for real-world trading.

Note
This trading strategy is a simplified example for educational purposes only and does not guarantee 
profitable results. Real-world trading involves complex factors and risks, and it’s erform thorough 
research and consult with financial experts before making any
ent decisions.
